üìù Project Report: ATS Resume Analyzer
1. Core Project Information
Project Name: ATS Resume
Brief Description (1‚Äì2 sentences):
A Streamlit-based application that evaluates resumes for ATS-friendliness using NLP and machine learning models.
Problem Statement / Use Case Solved:
Many resumes are filtered out by Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) due to formatting or missing keywords. This project helps job seekers check if their resumes are ATS-compatible.
Target Audience / End Users:
Job seekers, career coaches, HR professionals.
Project Timeline & Status: Prototype with functional demo (ongoing improvements possible).
2. Tech Stack
Frontend Technologies: Streamlit (Python-based UI).
Backend Technologies: Python (Flask not needed, Streamlit handles backend), scikit-learn (Naive Bayes, vectorization), pandas, numpy.
Development Tools & Environment: Jupyter Notebook (experimentation), Git/GitHub, VS Code.
Deployment Platforms & CI/CD Tools: Streamlit Cloud (ats-resume-asp.streamlit.app).
Third-party APIs or Services Integrated: None (self-contained ML).
3. Architecture & Design
System Architecture
Input: Resume text (via .txt or PDF).
Processing:
Text preprocessing (vectorization).
Classification via Naive Bayes model.
Resume category clustering (centroids).
Output: Score/report on ATS-friendliness.
(diagram can be added if needed)

Database schema & relationships
CSV files (resume_data.csv, resume_analysis_results.csv) used as datasets; no relational DB.
API structure & key endpoints
No REST API; app directly processes inputs via Streamlit.
Data flow & interactions
Resume ‚Üí Preprocessing ‚Üí Vectorizer ‚Üí ML Model ‚Üí ATS Score ‚Üí User Report.

Security measures implemented
None explicitly; relies on Streamlit sandbox.
Code Organization
Root: app.py (main entry point).
Models: ats_nb_model.pkl, ats_vectorizer.pkl.
Data: CSVs for training/testing.
Notebook: ATSresume.ipynb for experimentation.
Architecture style: Monolithic (single Streamlit app).

Design patterns: Standard ML pipeline (no advanced design patterns).

Key algorithms: Naive Bayes for classification; clustering for categories.

4. Features & Functionality
Core Features
Upload resume (txt/pdf).
Analyze resume for ATS-friendliness.
Keyword extraction & classification.
Provide ATS compatibility score.
Unique Selling Points
Lightweight, quick evaluation.
Works offline (except for Streamlit deployment).
Tailored to ATS parsing rules.
5. Technical Complexity
Challenges Faced
Handling multiple file formats (txt/pdf).
Preprocessing varied resume styles.
Creating ML models that generalize across industries.
Technical Decisions
Used Naive Bayes for simplicity & interpretability.
Chose Streamlit for fast prototyping & deployment.
CSV instead of SQL DB for minimal setup.
6. Development Process
Version Control & Collaboration
GitHub repo (no explicit branching strategy visible).
Individual project, so limited collaboration workflow.
Testing & Quality Assurance
No formal test framework detected.
Validation done via notebook & manual checks.
7. Performance & Metrics
Performance Indicators
Fast response (<1s per resume).
Lightweight models; memory efficient.
Analytics & Monitoring
No built-in monitoring.
Streamlit usage stats (via hosting).
8. Deployment & Operations
Deployment Strategy
Hosted on Streamlit Cloud.
Single environment (prod only).
No CI/CD pipelines beyond GitHub + Streamlit integration.
Maintenance & Updates
Repo updates handled manually.
Models can be retrained if dataset grows.
9. Learning & Growth
Learned deploying ML models with Streamlit.
Practical exposure to resume parsing challenges.
Experience with scikit-learn pipelines.
10. Future Enhancements
Add REST API for integration with other apps.
Support for DOCX format.
Better NLP models (transformers like BERT).
ATS-specific formatting checks (fonts, layouts).
Multi-language resume support.
11. Documentation & Communication
Technical Documentation
Basic README with setup instructions.
Requirements.txt for dependencies.
Minimal inline comments.
Project Presentation
Demo available at Streamlit App.
Example dataset included.
